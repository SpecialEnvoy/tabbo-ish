## Current Status

Might work, might not. Tested it out locally and on CodePen and so far it’s behaving fine-ish.

Didn’t bother splitting out the CSS/JS, ran into some weird issues while setting it up for Pages and I couldn’t be bothered.

## Potential?

I was bored and made this in like an hour, and I doubt this is the first. 

-- Client-side memory only.

-- Want to export to a VPS to add backend support soon-ish for custom games/cards. 

-- Seemed to work on a VM for mobile, but might break sooner or later.
